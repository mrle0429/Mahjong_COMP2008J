## Project Plan

### Overview:

**Step 1: Command Line Mahjong Game (Week 7 - 10)** 

- Develop a Mahjong game playable in the command line interface.
- Implement all essential game functionalities, including tile management, player actions (drawing, discarding), and basic rule enforcement (win conditions, scoring).
- Ensure the game is fully functional and playable solely through command line inputs.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues.

**Step 2: UI Interface Development (Week 11 - 12)**

- Design and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Mahjong game.
- Create intuitive UI elements for player interaction, including menus, game board, and player controls.
- Integrate visual and audio enhancements to improve user experience.
- Implement functionality to seamlessly transition between game states and handle user inputs.
- Conduct extensive testing to ensure the GUI version of the game is stable and user-friendly.

### Detailed

**Week 7 - 8: Foundation Establishment**

- Define fundamental game rules with precision, ensuring clarity and consistency.
- Finalize project documentation, including UML diagrams and member contribution delineation.
- Implement Mahjong tile classes and logic, including deck management, shuffling, and dealing functionalities.
- Enable core player interactions such as drawing and discarding tiles to establish basic gameplay mechanics.

**Week 9-10: Rule Logic Development**

- Engineer the intricate game rule logic, encompassing win conditions like "hu" (winning hand) and overarching victory criteria.
- Design the overall logic of how the game works.
- First Test.

**Week 11-12: UI Design and Enhancement**

- Design UI elements to enhance user experience, including main menu, game interface, and settings.
- Optimize game logic for seamless gameplay experience.

**Week 13-14: User Testing and Iteration**

- **Second Test**. Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback for iterative improvements.

**Week 15: Final Testing and Release Preparation**

- Prepare release version, including documentation and resource compilation.
- Finalize project submission.

## Task allocation

### Ziheng Wang

Responsible for defining game rules, ensuring their clarity and consistency, 
and designing overall game logic. He is also responsible for designing UI elements to enhance the user experience, 
such as the main menu and game interface, and preparing the release version in the final stages, 
including documentation and resource compilation.

### Le Liu

Responsible for finalizing project documentation, including UML diagrams and division of member contributions. 
He will implement complex game rules logic, including victory conditions and overall victory criteria, 
and collect feedback for iterative improvements during the user testing phase. 
Finally, he ensures the final submission of the project.

### Kuize Lu

Responsible for implementing the mahjong tile class and logic, including deck management, 
shuffling and dealing functions, and conducting the first test in the early stages. 
He will optimize game logic to ensure a smooth gaming experience and participate in iterative 
improvements during the second testing phase.

### Sicheng Yi

Responsible for enabling core player interactions such as drawing and discarding cards to establish basic game mechanics. 
He will be involved in designing the overall logic of the game and implementing UI features to 
ensure seamless game state transitions and handling of user input. During the user testing phase, 
he actively addresses feedback and makes necessary adjustments.
