## Project Introduction

Mahjong_COMP2008J is a Beijing Mahjong game that can be played both offline and online.

In the offline version, four players share a single computer to play the game. This mode is perfect for friends or family who are in the same location and want to play a game together.

The online version allows four players to play the game on their own computers. This mode is great for players who are in different locations but still want to enjoy a game of Mahjong together.

Please note that our version of Mahjong does not currently support the wildcard feature. We welcome contributions from developers who are interested in adding this feature to our game.
